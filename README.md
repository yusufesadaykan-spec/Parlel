 -> Whats Parlel
    "Parlel" is a programming language composed of functions and operators.
  But the best thing about "Parlel" is that it's moddable, because we developers know what modding is.

  ->Installing Parlel
    To install "Parlel", you first need to compile main.cpp and then parlelModder.cpp.
  Do not compile core.hpp and vanillaP.cpp while doing this.
  After compiling main.cpp and parlelModder.cpp, you need to run parlelModder and enter the file location of vanillaP.cpp for your mod to be installed.

    Note that when installing "Parlel," you need to compile VanillaP.cpp with Modder. This applies to all other mods as well.
