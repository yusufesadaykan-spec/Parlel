 -> Whats Parlel
    "Parlel" is a programming language composed of functions and operators.
  But the best thing about "Parlel" is that it's moddable, because we developers know what modding is.

  ->Installing Parlel
    To install Parlel, you first need to compile the main.cpp and then the parlelModder.cpp files.
   Do not compile the core.hpp and vanillaP.cpp files during this process.
   After compiling the main.cpp and parlelModder.cpp files, run parlelModder and enter the location of the vanillaP.cpp file for installation.
   Run the .prl file you want to use with the main.cpp file you compiled and enter the location of your file.

    Note that when installing "Parlel," you need to compile VanillaP.cpp with Modder. This applies to all other mods as well.
